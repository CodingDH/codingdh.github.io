## Project Background

DH has focused on developing best practices or teaching scholars how to use GitHub, but the ways in which scholars utilize GitHub and the impact on Digital Humanities (DH) research and teaching remain under explored. This poster introduces Coding DH, a data-driven project that utilizes GitHub data to examine how the platform has become a space for DH knowledge production and community formation.

1. **Identifying DH on GitHub**: How can we identify DH on a platform like GitHub? What are the possibilities and limitations of using GitHub’s API and data structures for studying communities, since it is not designed for large scale data collection? 

2. **Studying Global DH Coding Communities**: Given GitHub’s global reach, how can we study DH across linguistic communities, rather than focusing solely on English-speaking communities, and at the same time, how does English’s dominance in programming languages complicate this differentiation?

3. **Evolution of DH Coding Practices**: How does this data help us explore how DH coding practices have evolved over time, and at the same time, how much are these trends driven by new features on GitHub like the introduction of topics in 2017 which has resulted in the very popular “digital-humanities” topic?
